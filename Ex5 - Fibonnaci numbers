//Write a JavaScript function that computes the list of the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. 
By definition, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 0 and 1, and each 
subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. As an example, here are 
the first 10 Fibonnaci numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and 34.

			index ++;
