// Build a simple slide show in JavaScript. Create a basic page in html that displays a single image.
Add two buttons Previous and Next. These buttons should allow the user to move forward or
backward. Have 6 images in total. When the user reaches the end (or beginning when clicking on
the back button) of the slide show, the slide show should not wrap around to the beginning (or
end). When at the beginning of the slide show, only the Next button should be
visible. Conversely, when at the end, only the Previous button should be visible.
